## UX

<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome gideongannaban,
=======
This website is for friends and family who would normally celebrate together but are unable to do so because of the lockdown.  The website provides activities to undertake together, bith competetive and just for interest and fun.  The users are likely to include families, so the activities are suitable for all ages.  The users are likely to need to share the screen on a video call, so the design is clear and simple.

The owners of this website want to bring together people for a multitude of reasons, St Par=trick's Day is an enormous social celebration in Ireland and this website facilitates social activity to emulate that as far as possible.  It will also help those who might feel isolated in their celebration (or lack thereof) to feel included and part of the community they would normally engage with at this time of year.

## Features
Each page features consistent design to facilitate an intuitive and comfortable user experience.  There is a central home page with links directly to each game for quick and easy use.

The website has a number of games to choose from, meaning users do not have to switch through various sites to facilitate their celebration.
1. Trivia - Designed as a conversation feeder, an interesting and topical interactive experience to encourage dialog amongst participants.
2. Quiz - An interactive general Irish knowledge quiz.  Households can each open the page to complete the quiz and track their score, or all households can work together to try to beat the game and get top marks.  Set length to quiz to provide structure.
3. Prompts - An open ended interactive game where a card is drawn and each household ventures an answer.  The other households vote for their favourite, keeping score off-site.  There is no set length to this game.

### Existing Features
* Nav bar in universal standard position to help users feel intuitively at home with the site.  Uniform across all pages.
* Bright, on-theme design to help users feel part of a wider celebration.
